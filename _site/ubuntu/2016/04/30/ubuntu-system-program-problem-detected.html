<p>I had been getting “System program problem detected” error messages with no further info after upgrading my ubuntu to 15.10
<img src="/assests/img/ubuntu/problem-detected.png" alt="system program problem detected" /></p>

<p>It turns out that Ubuntu has an error reporting sytem called apport which tries to catch all program crashes in the background and report them to the developers.</p>

<p>Quick fixture: <strong>Remove old crash-reports</strong></p>

<p>See all the old crash-reports in the crash-report directory</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ls /var/crash
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Remove all old crash-reports that might exist in the crash-report directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo rm /var/crash/<span class="k">*</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The error messages will disappear on reboot.</p>
