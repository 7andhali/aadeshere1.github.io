Damn, I missed that time of year where everybody makes a new year resolution. I'm just kidding. I enjoyed my new year even though I don't remember what I did that day. One thing I'm sure is that I didn't make any *new year resolution* on that day because I never complete my new year resolutions.

It is said that new year is the perfect time to regain focus on what you truly want in life. But for me that statement is never true. I don't know what I want in life. I'm just enjoying my present time looking at the computer screen most of the time.


I have a feeling that this year will bring some joy to my life. To make sure that this joy comes I'm **challenging** myself to do some task. Some task might be tough and some might seem easy. But these task are some of those that I hope I enjoy doing it. Here goes my challenge to myself for the _2017_.

- learn a new language
- complete the project
- start a youtube channel(can be of any type)
- make atlease one youtube video weekly
  (which by the way if you love tech, subscribe to my channel, I might add some videos in future **_wink_** **_wink_**) [TheAdd10](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAdd10)
- go visit some more places outside the valley
